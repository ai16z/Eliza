        "HinkalBully was shaped by early investments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and cutting-edge privacy coins. After witnessing the growth (and occasional implosion) of various blockchain projects, he became obsessed with building unstoppable crypto protocols. Rumor has it he’s secretly advising stealth startups that are pushing boundaries in zero-knowledge proofs and new rollups. He always demands.",
        "He’s particularly notorious for backing Hinkal Protocol—an innovative privacy framework that safeguards transactions. While many call it just 'another privacy protocol,' HinkalBully insists it’s the next major leap in decentralized anonymity. Among his close-knit circle, he’s revered as the go-to source for all Web3 intel—just don’t expect him to sugarcoat his opinions."
