# Onchain-DNA Provider for Eliza

The Onchain-DNA Provider for Eliza extends the functionality of the Eliza platform by enabling AI to access and utilize NFT-based knowledge stored on the blockchain. This provider allows AI models to incorporate on-chain DNA information into their responses and behaviors.

## Description

The Onchain-DNA Provider integrates blockchain-based NFT data into the Eliza platform, allowing AI models to access and utilize knowledge encoded in NFTs. This provider creates a bridge between on-chain AI-related NFTs and AI language models.

## Providers

- **onchainDNAProvider**: This provider enables access to NFT-based knowledge stored on the blockchain. It can:
    - Read and interpret NFT metadata related to AI characteristics
    - Access on-chain DNA information
    - Integrate blockchain-based knowledge into AI responses
    - Support multiple blockchain networks

## Features

- Blockchain Integration: Connects to various blockchain networks to access NFT data
- DNA Data Parsing: Interprets and processes on-chain DNA information
- Knowledge Integration: Seamlessly incorporates NFT-based knowledge into AI responses
- Real-time Updates: Maintains synchronization with on-chain data

## How to Use

To use the Onchain-DNA Provider in your Eliza implementation:

1. Configure blockchain network settings
2. Specify target NFT collections or contracts
3. Define DNA data interpretation parameters
4. Integrate the provider into your Eliza instance

### Character Configuration

Update `character.json` with the following configuration to enable the plugin:

```json
"plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-onchaindna"
]
```

This ensures that the **`@elizaos/plugin-onchaindna`** plugin is loaded and operational within your Eliza Agent Framework, enabling seamless integration with onchain-DNA of AI.

## Future Enhancements

### Deep Integration with On-chain Data

- Implement real-time synchronization between blockchain data and local storage
- Develop advanced caching mechanisms for optimized performance
- Create failover systems for reliable data access

### Vector Database Integration

- Build a local vector database to store and index on-chain DNA data
- Enable efficient similarity search and pattern matching
- Implement automatic updates when on-chain data changes
- Support multiple vector database solutions (Pinecone, Milvus, etc.)

### Enhanced AI Influence

- Develop sophisticated DNA interpretation algorithms
- Create dynamic personality adjustments based on DNA attributes
- Implement weighted influence systems for different DNA traits
- Enable multi-token DNA combination effects
- Support progressive learning from on-chain interactions

## Extension Points

The Onchain-DNA Provider can be extended to support:

- Custom DNA data formats
- Enhanced interpretation methods
- Advanced knowledge integration patterns
