I'll help you create a text and voice plugin for Eliza that integrates Deepgram/Whisper for speech-to-text, Elevenlabs for text-to-speech, and SMS functionality.



I've created a comprehensive plugin implementation for voice and text support in Eliza. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. Main Plugin Structure:
- Exports a single plugin object that bundles all services
- Modular design with separate services for each capability

2. TranscriptionService:
- Supports both Whisper and Deepgram for STT
- Handles multiple audio formats
- Includes error handling and fallback options

3. VoiceService:
- Integrates with ElevenLabs for TTS
- Configurable voice and model options
- Handles audio generation and streaming

4. TextService:
- Implements SMS functionality using Twilio
- Supports both sending and receiving messages
- Webhook handler for incoming messages

To use this plugin:

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pnpm add @deepgram/sdk elevenlabs-node twilio openai
```

2. Configure environment variables in your character file or .env:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=xxx
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xxx
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=xxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=xxx
```

3. Add the plugin to your character configuration:
```json
{
  "plugins": ["@ai16z/plugin-voice-text"]
}
```

To meet the acceptance criteria:
1. The code is ready for a pull request
2. For video demonstration:
   - Set up a test environment with all API keys
   - Record demonstration of:
     - Speech-to-text using both Whisper and Deepgram
     - Text-to-speech using ElevenLabs
     - SMS sending and receiving via Twilio

Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail or help with setting up the demonstration?
